# Splines
Using linear interpolation allows a user to draw &amp; manipulate bezier curves on java fx.

Run the file BezierCurves, (it is a javafx Application).

Use the slider to draw out the bezier curve (yellow dots). if it stops drawing click fix slider.

Currently removing points doens't work so it starts at 3.

You can add points though, although currently it seems to break at adding 1 more.

You can drag the points around, but it is very laggy at times because the curve automatically adjusts. You can also move the points by entering a coordinate and pressing the set new cords button.

The clear button clears the curve.
